Retrieve the Username and Balance of users who have made a 'Buy' transaction of more than
0.1 coins on or after '2024-01-01'.
Additionally, display the CryptoName and the total amount (in COINS) bought for each user.
Ensure the result is ordered in descending order based on the total amount bought.
Write an SQL query that satisfies the conditions mentioned above. You should use
subqueries to achieve this.

SELECT
    u.Username,
    u.Balance,
    (SELECT c.CryptoName FROM Cryptocurrencies c WHERE c.CryptoID = t.CryptoID) AS CryptoName,
    SUM(t.Amount) AS TotalAmount
FROM Users u
INNER JOIN Transactions t ON u.UserID = t.UserID
WHERE t.CryptoID IN (SELECT c.CryptoID FROM Cryptocurrencies c)
GROUP BY u.UserID, t.CryptoID;
